### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of terminal commands.

### Install Commands

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository and enter directory and get all submodules:
git clone git@github.com:fleetbase/fleetbase.git && cd fleetbase
git submodule update --init --recursive

# 2. Start the services using docker-compose:
docker compose up -d

# 3. Enter the application container (could also be `fleetbase_application_1`):
docker exec -ti fleetbase-application-1 bash

# 4. Run the Deploy script:
sh deploy.sh

# 5. For development stop the console container
docker compose down console

# 6. Run the development server for the console
cd console && pnpm install && pnpm start
```

### Linking Packages for Development

If you'd like to customize or contribute to a Fleetbase extension, the extension must be linked first for changes to appear. For working on frontend development you will need to link the packages via the `package.json`.

```json
// package.json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "@fleetbase/fleetops-engine": "link:../packages/fleetops"
    }
}
```

If you need to do backend development, packages must be linked as well via `composer.json`. See the example below for linking a local package to the Fleetbase API.

```json
// composer.json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "../packages/core-api"
        },
        {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "../packages/fleetops"
        }
    ]
}
```

Fleetbase packages contain both the frontend and server side code. For a Fleetbase extensions the frontend code will be located in the `/addon` directory while the server side code will be located in the `/server` directory. You can learn more about developing your own extension or contributing to an existing extension in the developers section.

### Develop in Docker

If you'd like to develop in the Docker environment you need to setup volume mounts so that both the console and the API are able to access linked packages. Additionally you will also need to set the environment to `development` so that the console can reload on detected changes.

The following setup should allow you to setup a development environment in Docker.

```yml
services:
    console:
        build:
            context: .
            dockerfile: console/Dockerfile.server-build
            args:
                ENVIRONMENT: development
        ports:
            - "4200:4200"
        volumes:
            - ./console:/app/console
            - ./packages:/app/packages

    application:
        build:
            context: .
            dockerfile: docker/Dockerfile
            target: app-dev
            args:
                ENVIRONMENT: development
        volumes:
            - ./api:/fleetbase/api
            - ./packages:/fleetbase/packages
```
