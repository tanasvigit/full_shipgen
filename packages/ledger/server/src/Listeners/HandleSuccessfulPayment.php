 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   1. If an invoice_uuid can be resolved from the gateway transaction,
 *      call InvoiceService::recordPayment() to mark the invoice paid and
 *      create the DEBIT Cash / CREDIT AR journal entry.
 *   2. If no invoice is linked (e.g. a standalone gateway charge), fall back
 *      to a direct DEBIT Cash / CREDIT Revenue entry so revenue is never lost.
 *   3. Mark the GatewayTransaction as processed (idempotency seal).
 *
 * This listener is queued to prevent blocking the webhook HTTP response.
 * If the job fails, it will be retried automatically by the queue worker.

     * Resolve the Ledger invoice UUID from a gateway transaction.
     *
     * Different gateway drivers and webhook paths store the invoice reference
     * in different locations. This method checks all known paths in order of
     * reliability and returns the first non-empty value found, or null.
     *
     * Known locations:
     *
     * 1. raw_response.invoice_uuid
     *    Set by PaymentService::persistTransaction() for direct API purchases
     *    (Stripe PaymentIntent, QPay invoice). This is the most reliable path
     *    because Ledger itself writes it.
     *
     * 2. raw_response.metadata.invoice_uuid
     *    Stripe stores the metadata object inside the PaymentIntent. When a
     *    Stripe webhook fires, the raw payload is stored as-is, so the
     *    metadata block is nested one level deeper.
     *
     * 3. raw_response.data.object.metadata.invoice_uuid
     *    Stripe webhook events wrap the PaymentIntent under data.object.
     *    Some webhook shapes nest it here instead of at the top level.
     *
     * 4. response->data['invoice_uuid']
     *    The GatewayResponse DTO's normalised data bag. Drivers may populate
     *    this for non-Stripe gateways that carry the reference in their own
     *    response body.
     *
     * @param GatewayTransaction $gatewayTransaction The persisted gateway transaction record
     * @param GatewayResponse    $response           The normalised gateway response DTO
     *
     * @return string|null The resolved invoice UUID/public_id, or null if not found
